# NFL-Compare
Shiny Application to Display and Compare stats of NFL Players and Teams  
  
old Shiny uses Stattleship's API, which now requires $ donation to have an API Key activated.  
  
new Shiny uses a static DataFrame for the time being.  
It technically uses data from nflgame, a Python wrapper for NFL Game Data API, which is consistently updated.  
Work in Progress.
